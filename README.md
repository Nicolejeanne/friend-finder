# Friend-finder

## Express assignment

I am currently a student in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. after spending a few months on client-side development, we are beginning to learn about the back-end. Our week 15 assignment is to create an app using express and host it on Heroku for the first time. This app will present you with a survey of questions and will determine your "best friend" match by comparing the provided answers to an array of previous users' answers.
